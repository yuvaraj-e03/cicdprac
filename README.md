# ToDo App with CI/CD Pipeline

A simple ToDo app built with React and integrated with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## CI/CD Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment process to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Workflow Steps
